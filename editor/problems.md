## HOW WILL COMICS RESCALE FOR MOBILE DEVICES!?!?!?

So, my idea is that we'll have 2 sizes of "artboards", a primary one (desktop) and a secondary one (mobile). Mostly we work in the primary artboard, but then we can LINK entities from primary to secondary (like a symbolic copy?).

## HOW WILL WE HANDLE MULTIPLE FONT SIZES

Two options I see:
1. we don't let text resize (HOW>?!?!)
2. we plan for text resizing and work with it (HARD... happy users?)
